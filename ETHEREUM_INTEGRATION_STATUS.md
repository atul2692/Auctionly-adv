# Ethereum Integration Status

## Problem Solved
We have successfully resolved the connection issue with the Ethereum blockchain integration. The error was due to attempting to connect to a local Ethereum node (Ganache) at `127.0.0.1:8545` that wasn't running.

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Updated Network Configuration**: 
   - Modified `settings.py` to use Infura's Sepolia testnet instead of a local Ganache node
   - Successfully configured with your Infura API key: `c592d537c4514e66b9af8b15770bc347`

2. **Created Helper Scripts**:
   - `ethereum/get_infura_key.py`: For setting up Infura API key
   - `test_direct_connection.py`: For testing connection without Django dependencies 
   - `test_event_listener.py`: For testing event listening functionality

3. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Enhanced the event listener to handle connection errors gracefully
   - Added retry mechanisms for connection issues

4. **Deployment Configuration**:
   - Updated Hardhat configuration to include Sepolia testnet
   - Created a deployment script for Sepolia (`ethereum/scripts/deploy-sepolia.js`)

## Current Status

âœ… **Connection to Ethereum Network**: Successfully connecting to Sepolia testnet via Infura  
âœ… **Web3 Instance**: Working properly  
âœ… **Block Query**: Successfully retrieving latest block number  
âœ… **Event Listening Logic**: Successfully implemented and tested  

ðŸŸ  **Contract Deployment**: Placeholder contract address, needs actual deployment  
ðŸŸ  **Django Integration**: Needs Django environment setup for full integration

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Smart Contracts**:
   ```bash
   # Set environment variables
   $env:INFURA_SEPOLIA_URL="https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/c592d537c4514e66b9af8b15770bc347"
   $env:PRIVATE_KEY="your_ethereum_private_key"  # Replace with your private key
   
   # Deploy contracts
   cd ethereum
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-sepolia.js --network sepolia
   ```

2. **Update Contract Address**:
   - After deployment, update `AUCTION_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in `settings.py` with the real address

3. **Test Full Integration**:
   - Run the Django development server: `python manage.py runserver`
   - Test the auction creation and bidding workflow

4. **Monitor Events**:
   - Run the event listener to monitor blockchain events: 
   ```python
   from ethereum.event_listener import EventListener
   listener = EventListener()
   listener.run()  # Or listener.run(run_once=True) for testing
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated: `.\env\Scripts\activate`
2. Verify web3 is installed: `pip install web3 django python-dotenv requests`
3. Confirm your Infura API key is valid and has access to Sepolia testnet
4. Make sure your contract is properly deployed on Sepolia
